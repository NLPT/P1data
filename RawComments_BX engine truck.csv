The rotary is not dead, it&#39;s an excellent choice for a range extender.","<BX> Trucks launches the new <BX> FH – Next generation of truck designed with the driver in mind<br /><br />featuring a re-imagined cab, innovative safety features and a driver focused working environment. A key aim of the new design is to give the driver a more productive, safe and comfortable life on the road.<br /><br />Driver focus helps attract skilled professionals<br />The emphasis on drivers is based on the significant impact they have on a haulier’s results, in terms of productivity, efficiency and customer service.<br /><br />Interior gives drivers superior working environment<br />The attention given to drivers is most obvious in the updated interior working environment. Their workspace is centered around a modernized dashboard which features a fully digital 12-inch high resolution instrument display and includes a fixed cup holder and an open storage space with motion-sensor controlled lighting. The instrument display allows the driver to choose between four different screen views, depending on the driving situation and the information they prefer to have displayed.<br /><br />An optional 9-inch side display can provide infotainment, navigation assistance, transport information and camera monitoring. The display, that is easy to reach, allows the driver to interact in numerous ways: with the intuitively positioned buttons on the steering wheel, through voice control, or directly via the touchscreen and display control panel.<br /><br />Sophisticated design and smart technologies<br />The bold new look of the exterior is characterized by the signature V-shaped headlights which have now been moved outwards to align with the feature line of the cab doors. The turn indicators have also been moved to the door, giving the truck both improved aerodynamics and a more confident look. The wiper panel is cleaner and slimmer while a bigger iron mark makes the new <BX> FH easily recognizable even from a distance.<br /><br /><br />Industry-first safety feature: Adaptive high beam headlights<br />The new <BX> FH is the world’s first heavy duty truck with adaptive high beam headlights. The system improves safety for all road users by automatically disabling selected segments of the LED high beam when the truck approaches oncoming traffic or another vehicle from behind. The high beam is adjusted when the camera and radar detect other vehicles or when the camera detects changes in the amount of light around the truck.<br /><br />Improved fuel efficiency and productivity<br />Using various driveline and chassis configurations, the new <BX> FH can be tailored to suit a wide range of applications and enable significant fuel and CO2savings. In long-haul operations for instance, the new <BX> FH with I-Save for Euro 6 combines the new <M2>TC engine with a package of features and can deliver fuel savings up to 7%*. There have also been improvements for the Euro 3 and 5 versions with features like <BX> Torque Assist.<br /><br />New service contract helps customers improve their cash flow<br />The rapid development of connected services gives hauliers completely new ways of increasing vehicle uptime and optimizing vehicle utilization.<br /><br />Facts about the new <BX> FH<br /><br />Cabs: Low sleeper cab, Sleeper cab, Globetrotter cab, Globetrotter XL and Globetrotter XXL. Exterior and interior trim packages for individual design.<br /><br />Engines: Diesel engines are available with different emissions standards. <BX> FH is also available with Euro 6, Step D compliant gas-powered LNG engine in selected markets.<br /><br /><BX> FH with I-Save for Euro 6 is available in selected markets.<br /><br />Gear changing system: I-Shift / I-Shift Dual Clutch with software packages for different areas of application.<br /><br />*The fuel improvement claim is calculated by comparing costs of diesel and AdBlue for <M2>TC Euro 6 step D with the Long Haul Fuel Package (I-Save) to <M2> eSCR Euro 6 step D without the Long Haul Fuel Package. Actual fuel economy may vary depending on many factors such as the driver’s experience, use of cruise control, vehicle specification, vehicle load, actual topography, vehicle maintenance and weather conditions.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23<BX>"">#<BX></a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23<BX>Trucks"">#<BX>Trucks</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23<BX>FH"">#<BX>FH</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23New"">#New</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NewTruck"">#NewTruck</a><br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a href=""https://goo.gl/pL84j2"">https://goo.gl/pL84j2</a><br /><br />New Car Videos: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/AlphaSQUADofficial/videos"">https://www.youtube.com/c/AlphaSQUADofficial/videos</a><br />Google+: <a href=""https://goo.gl/QWO4jX"">https://goo.gl/QWO4jX</a><br />YouTube: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/AlphaSQUADofficial"">https://www.youtube.com/c/AlphaSQUADofficial</a><br />Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AlphaSQUADofficial"">https://www.facebook.com/AlphaSQUADofficial</a><br />Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/AlphaSQUADofficial"">https://www.instagram.com/AlphaSQUADofficial</a><br />Website: <a href=""http://www.alphasquadofficial.com/"">http://www.AlphaSQUADofficial.com</a><br />Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/AlphaSQUAD_1"">https://twitter.com/AlphaSQUAD_1</a><br />Snapchat: AlphaSQUAD_1<br />Submit Your Video: AlphaSQUAD.PR@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>",I’m high somehow I landed here help,I want to learn more,"I bought my first Brand New Semi truck was a <BX> 780. 2014.

They have the best computers in them, they have been the most reliable.  They are not the fastest, nor the most powerful, but again, they are the safest in 2018.  They have downhill cruise control, which most of you will have no idea about unless you have driven one.  I drive mostly in the Mountain States, in the snow, in the wind, and across the Mojave desert.  Their computers can control your downhill speed on 6% grades to the T.  The controls are all on the steering column stalk.  No reaching down to flip the engine brake from high to medium to low, and back to medium and high.  You do not need to constantly stare at the speedometer, with one hand off the wheel to control your downhill or your cruise speed.  I&#39;ve been in a VN for almost 10 years.  Yes, I miss my long nose, but could not make as much money as I can with the Volov&#39;s fuel mileage, dependability, and safety features.  They may not have the most comfortable bunks, but a real driver spends way more time behind the wheel than in the bunk.

It&#39;s unit Enjector system,thank  <BX>,Nice video,"For me, the cruise control engine brake is not so big innovation.  First, what is the difference between keeping the speed down the hill automatically or do it my self with the engine brake handle? Not a big problem to do it by your self. I need my crouse speed to be different for every hill and you must set the crouse engine brake every time differently for any situation. That&#39;s why I prefer to do that manually. And finally, <M2> is not a reliable engine at all. Replacing the injectors 2 or 3 times per the truck life will not save you any money. The seal may go bad and leak oil between the engine and the AT transmission after 400k miles. The engine needs to be removed to fix that seal and that&#39;s will cost you a lot of money. You can&#39;t idle much with the <M2> engine because will plug quickly the DEF filter. Even if you idle your fuel economy will be 1 gallon per hour. And that&#39;s will cost you a lot of money. I got another <BX> truck 2006 with a D12 engine and a 13-speed manual. I can idle as much as I want burning only 0.5 gallons per hour fuel. The truck has more than a million miles on the engine and never replaced a single injector yet. Still running strong averaging  7.3 miles per gallon fuel economy.

That is a normal maintenance.  Second the biggest preventive measure for the aftertreament system on the <M2> engine, <M1>, mp7 and mp8, d16, and mp10 engines are air dryer services. Moisture gets in the Ahi module and wipes them out. The 7th injector or aftertreament fuel injector is a wear and tear item and is not expensive to replace.  The only non diy item is a parameter reset after replacement.   Fuel Injectors require retorque as part of a valve adjustment.  The retorque enusures contact with the cup.  What this video illustrates as the 7th injector is the def doser.  Yes it wlll build up with crystals. That will lead to codes like p02ee faults or other nox efficiency faults.  ALSO there are two different NOX sensor on Macks and <BX>s.  The color of the connector indicate inlet and outlet.  Both require a parameter reset.

Cars – affordable for the general public – with engines of about 1 litre fuel consumption, or cars with real water-using engines have been ready for production for over 2 decades now. These high-tech prototypes were successfully tested in countries like Canada, USA, Australia, Norway, England, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Germany, Poland, France, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Israel, China, India, South Korea and Japan. We should already be manufacturing 35-40 million emission-free vehicles annually, and H2O engine systems should have been producing energy instead of our fossil-based and nuclear power plants. Entire technological documentations of such technologies have vanished in the EU`s Institute for Innovation and Technology, and, according to the legislation in order, it is right to be so. The expense involved in the production of such technologies is half of that of the traditional engines, they weigh about 70% less, and they can provide a huge torque. Their working range can be several thousand miles, cars could weigh 200 kg less, and their price could be 3-4000 Euros less. Segments of nearly the entire car industry secretly have the prototypes and successful tests. At the present moment we are poisoning our environment just out of mere arrogance and greed.

I was told I had to clean my DPF, I had to replace the doser (otherwise the truck wouldn’t do a regen), and they also said I had to replace one of the injectors. Not sure which one. And also 2 knock sensors. After all of this, the truck seemed to run okay for few days but then I noticed something odd about the transmission. I never had any issues with my transmission before. The problem is becoming more and more obvious. When cruising on a straight road, it automatically downshifts to lower gear for few seconds, making the engine scream. When pressing the gas, you can feel a bit of a vibration (never had this issue before) and also, when backing up a trailer, it starts reversing with R1 which makes the truck jerk and shake crazy so I have to manually upshift the gear to r2. I called the shop and they can’t give me any tip other than calling me back to the shop. Can you guys help me out figuring out what might be the issue?
