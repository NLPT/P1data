25,,top,,,not sure what year they started putting the new double idler gear bull gear the updated one ha some mark on it which you can tell apart what still fails is the idler gear that drive the tandem pump valve still break off and cause damage lucky yours did not damage the liner or piston,do not waist your money <BX> engine are good engine but mucho money to fix it jus get another engine from 8500 to 13500 and get back to the road by the way i have a 2010 <BX> <M2> 678 000 mile who is interested let me know i am in san antonio tx it s 500 dollar for shiping,,,if we built these engine with 30percent kevlar we can cut the weight by about 400 pound and increase the torque to 5000 foot pound this will accelerate to keep with traffic,,rember that gear do not wann forget,this make tesla s future truck concept already outdated <BX> is leading and now,yes every <BX> rpm go to 1500 at 70 75,<BX> is the best i love <BX>,no need,you might think so but history prof otherwise my dad worked on another turbocompounded engine the wright r 3350 and the turbocompounding system wa extremely reliable all it had to do wa spin the unreliability stemmed from the reciprocating part of the engine the valve would would break escape the piston through the exhaust hit the turbocompounders and break them,it s just upgraded fh nothing new nor special more sensor electronics to fuck your day up i wonder if you can dim the display in this one so it doe not blind you at night,,,cummins is a good motor just have to put bypass engine oil filter and secondary lower micron filter on them once a cummins ha that they can last 1 1 5million without rebuilding <BX> were smart enough to do this from the beginning making there motor much more reliable
26,,these truck are incredible in their driver comfort and amenity i have to wonder why since driverless truck are just over the horizon a i read it driver will be pretty much obsolete within 10 15 year if you get the chance to drive and live in one of these truck grab it with both hand and be one of the last of a breed again a i understand it tomorrow s truck will look much like today s yard tractor oshkosh etc with a small basic cabin provided for when the truck actually ha to be driven by a human,,,thinking about buying a <BX> with a <M2> automatic it ha a million mile what s your advice i will test drive it soon he want $ 15 000,i preffer a freightliner coronado with detroit 60 series engine,30 90 8400 540 464,,rebuild aaye,,good job <BX>,technologie tr s avanc e tr s impressionnante pour un camion bravo <BX>,question i have a 2017 vnl780 with the <M2> the issue im having is when driving in hot temp or loaded climbing hill my coolant is forcing it way out of the overflow tube on the side of the reservoir tank ive changed the pressure cap already and it still doe it someone mentioned that it could be a bad air compressor cause they said coolant run through it any idea of what i should check or replace thanks,thanks for your support,top liner seal never get oiled or lubricated,detroit diesel had similar sistem on dd15 and many people hated it sure hope <BX> doe it better,,,,<BX> every time engine life is almost double the average isx inframe
27,,i like the cabin before this model much more,,,what james said 900 million mile you are asking for trouble especially if the engine ha not been rebuilt or replaced not to mention a million other thing go with a series 60 detroit or a cummins is what i would say preferably a n14 cummins best of luck to you,yeah simple truck very reliable but now emission system are all about money and business,which particle break your lateral attitude,,0 23 curbkiller,,duh i knead 5 mi nut to thunk what gear iz neck,bravo,at 500k mile that s not a bad list compared to isx most engine the turbos injector egr after treatment etc will need work or replacement around 400k so a $ 10k preventive investment before 500k sound reasonable repeat before 900k and get the bearing done if you have not and you will drive pas 1 million mile without major headache o o use your reset hour wisely on pm,<BX> is the best,i used the old gasket but i used gasket victor reinz,are we getting this engine on the fh in europe a well,,,,shukhrat rahimkulov <BX> <M2> is a great engine now if you buy cummins now you just throwing money away because they go out way faster then <M2> <BX> engine cummins do not know how to build engine anymore like they did before never buy a new engine that did not get good reputation yet wait till someone else test new engine then make a choice there is many good engine out there but even more shitty onces

329,,,,,,,,,,,,,adrain <BX>s are nice truck and the ride is like no other thanks for watching and make sure to subscribe,,,,pretty underwhelmed i wa expecting a new look front end especially a they have just launched the new fm which is 6 yr after the fh4 launch scania replaced their entire range within 3 year and now this is the best <BX> can offer poor in my opinion wait till daf launch their new range that will wake the other manufacturer up,,,
330,,,,,,,,,,,,,so basically get a detroit for my first truck lol,,,,<BX> like to do thing on the cheap,,,
331,,,,,,,,,,,,,just get a freightliner cascadia im thinkn,,,,daf they are a fleet truck and so are <BX> to a degree from driving my first f89 <BX> in 1974 to my last in march an fh4 540 i have always liked <BX> i know i will come back into the business again a retirement doe not suit this time i may buy a scania s 650 but the depreciation will be high may buy a 2 year old r580 a i know one is available with little use it wa one of the last r580s sold there is nothing like the scania v8 engine 2 million without problem i have always serviced my truck at 30k kilometre even though they were saying 60 or 70k wa soon enough not for me a i am old school and i always believed in first class maintenance good luck with the daf,,,
332,,,,,,,,,,,,,i would just focus on maintenance history and having truck checked by an outside shop,,,,globe trotter i prefer earth runner perhaps,,,
333,,,,,,,,,,,,,tat express inc yeah but buying used seems like alot more stuff to be worried about,,,,<BX>ooo,,,
334,,,,,,,,,,,,,rodney <M2> are good engine a well a mentioned before maintenance is key,,,,<BX> fh 16 truck design beauty very good,,,
335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,what about the poor seat <BX> are renowned for and the lack of everyday storage <BX> u most certainly do not have the driver in mind,,,
336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jan schlossar if u know anything about truck a xf is a better driver truck than a fh4 do not get me wrong it s not perfect when i wa your age i wa all power and speed now iam in my 60 it s comfort and daf win,,,

345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rick zune how do you work that out i bet you have not even been in one much more comfort leg room and a better ride in an american type truck than a euro we have both here in australia and i have driven enough of both to know what i prefer,,,
346,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nah it will most likely be sold all over the world just not in the u that market prefer it s old tech and cheap low quality truck to much which on the otherhand result in u truck having minimal to no marketshare outside the u sadly it s the same with u car,,,
347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,so you think an uncomfortable driver is somehow a better driver strange theory,,,
348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,beautiful better then benz mercedes,,,
349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,well there is a reason <BX> dominates the market and mercedes is considerd a low quality alternative after all,,,
350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,very nice truck,,,
