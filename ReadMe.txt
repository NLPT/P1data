P1data contains 3 sets of YouTube comments based on 3 sets of search words in the format of “brand/company product model”. 
Each set of comments is available in the original form (RawComments) and preprocessed form (CleanedComments).
For confidentiality reasons, the “brand/company” of the product is coded as <BX> in the data.
The “product” in this case was an “engine”.  
Three sets of “model” were used in the search: 
  - The first model was “truck”, which is a generic description of the model type. 
  - The second and third models have unique names and are coded as <M1> and <M2> in the data.
