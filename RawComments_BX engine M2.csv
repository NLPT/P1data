They have downhill cruise control, which most of you will have no idea about unless you have driven one.  I drive mostly in the Mountain States, in the snow, in the wind, and across the Mojave desert.  Their computers can control your downhill speed on 6% grades to the T.  The controls are all on the steering column stalk.  No reaching down to flip the engine brake from high to medium to low, and back to medium and high.

First, what is the difference between keeping the speed down the hill automatically or do it my self with the engine brake handle? Not a big problem to do it by your self. I need my crouse speed to be different for every hill and you must set the crouse engine brake every time differently for any situation. That&#39;s why I prefer to do that manually. And finally, <M2> is not a reliable engine at all. Replacing the injectors 2 or 3 times per the truck life will not save you any money. The seal may go bad and leak oil between the engine and the AT transmission after 400k miles. The engine needs to be removed to fix that seal and that&#39;s will cost you a lot of money. You can&#39;t idle much with the <M2> engine because will plug quickly the DEF filter. Even if you idle your fuel economy will be 1 gallon per hour. And that&#39;s will cost you a lot of money. I got another <BX> truck 2006 with a D12 engine and a 13-speed manual. I can idle as much as I want burning only 0.5 gallons per hour fuel. The truck has more than a million miles on the engine and never replaced a single injector yet. Still running strong averaging  7.3 miles per gallon fuel economy.

62,"Just as good as any modern day cummins, Detroit ect.... all more or less the same nowadays üëç",,"First off the 7th injector is right behind the turbo. That is a normal maintenance.  Second the biggest preventive measure for the aftertreament system on the <M2> engine, <M1>, mp7 and mp8, d16, and mp10 engines are air dryer services. Moisture gets in the Ahi module and wipes them out. The 7th injector or aftertreament fuel injector is a wear and tear item and is not expensive to replace.  The only non diy item is a parameter reset after replacement.   Fuel Injectors require retorque as part of a valve adjustment.  The retorque enusures contact with the cup.  What this video illustrates as the 7th injector is the def doser.  Yes it wlll build up with crystals. That will lead to codes like p02ee faults or other nox efficiency faults.  ALSO there are two different NOX sensor on Macks and <BX>s.  The color of the connector indicate inlet and outlet.  Both require a parameter reset.  If you mix up the sensors you will end up with a communication fault.  On high mileage <BX>s, pay close attention to THE DOUBLE IDLER GEAR!!!!!!

I was told I had to clean my DPF, I had to replace the doser (otherwise the truck wouldn‚Äôt do a regen), and they also said I had to replace one of the injectors. Not sure which one. And also 2 knock sensors. After all of this, the truck seemed to run okay for few days but then I noticed something odd about the transmission. I never had any issues with my transmission before. The problem is becoming more and more obvious. When cruising on a straight road, it automatically downshifts to lower gear for few seconds, making the engine scream. When pressing the gas, you can feel a bit of a vibration (never had this issue before) and also, when backing up a trailer, it starts reversing with R1 which makes the truck jerk and shake crazy so I have to manually upshift the gear to r2. I called the shop and they can‚Äôt give me any tip other than calling me back to the shop. Can you guys help me out figuring out what might be the issue? Thank you",@Ridho Mekanik MID berapa?
